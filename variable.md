variables are like labels for values.
we can store a value and give it a name so that we can refer back to it late, 
use that value to do ..stufff, or change it later on.

making variables

let score = 0;
score = 5;
score = score + 5;

score += 5; increment
score -= 5; decrement
score *= 10; 
score /= 10; 


let numLives = 9;
numLives -= 1;
numLives--; decrement
numLives++; increment

the const keyword arguments that doesn't change.
const countNum = 1;


Naming convention

* use camel case for naming javascript variables names
* never start a javascript variables name with a digit
* use underscore in place of camel case
* make sure your names are understandable by users.
